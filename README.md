This is packer.  I will try to upload a runnable jar.  If I have not done this, simply copy the entire packer folder into a Java IDE (eclipse is what I used, if that helps) and run the file.

The goal of the game is to hack the big computer in the center of the building.  It is hard to do but far from impossible.  Big hint, the AI is very dumb and can be exploited to some degree by finding locations where you can shoot them, but they can't shoot you.

Controls are:

w a s d to move,

arrowkeys to shoot,

space (next to a dead robot) to begin hacking.

any key(s) pressed and released rapidly to hack

enter to play again (on a win / lose screen)

Art and Code was done by me, but I did use onine tutorials for parts I didn't know / remember how to do.

Enjoy!
