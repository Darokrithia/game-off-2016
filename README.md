This is packer.  I will try to upload a runnable jar.  If I have not done this, simply copy the entire packer folder into a Java IDE (eclipse is what I used, if that helps) and run the file.

The goal of the game is to hack the big computer in the center of the building.

Controls are:

w a s d to move,

arrowkeys to shoot,

space (next to a dead robot) to begin hacking.

any key(s) pressed and released rapidly to hack

enter to play again (on a win / lose screen)

Art and Code was done by me, but I did use onine tutorials for parts I didn't know / remember how to do.

Enjoy!


WARNING:  I am bad at git hub and there are some redundant files.  Use the newer packer and ignore the extra /bin and /src folders.  Also gram the /res from the old packer.  If anyone knows how to delete files PLEASE let me know
